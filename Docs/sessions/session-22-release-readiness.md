# Session 22: Release readiness

**Recommended model:** Sonnet 5.5
**How to start:** first commit the previous session's work if you have not yet. Then open a fresh Claude Code chat in `S:/Personal_Projects/X-RIM` and paste everything below the line.

---

You are continuing work on X-RIM, a 2D mobile (iOS and Android) Unity game: a simultaneous-turn, physics-driven melee duel between crash-test dummies. The project root is `S:/Personal_Projects/X-RIM`. It uses Unity 6000.5.2f1, URP 2D, the Input System only, and the Unity Test Framework. I am the game's designer, not a programmer.

This chat is **Session 22: Release readiness** of the build plan in `Docs/SESSION_PLAN.md`. You remember nothing from earlier chats; everything you need is in the files named below.

## 1. Read before doing anything

1. `CLAUDE.md`: project rules and conventions. Where it differs from `MEMORY.md` or this prompt on how we work (for example git), `MEMORY.md` and this prompt win, because they are newer.
2. `MEMORY.md`, all of it: status, decisions, placeholders, deviations, known issues, open questions and playtest reports.
3. `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Earlier sessions kept it up to date with what they built.
4. `Docs/SESSION_PLAN.md`: §4 (decisions, including *Later decisions*), §5 (checkpoints), §6 (rules) and the Session 22 entry in §7.
5. The GDD, `Docs/X-RIM — Game Design Document.pdf`, which is the source of truth for rules. Never edit it.
   - Extract its text with `pdftotext -layout "Docs/X-RIM — Game Design Document.pdf" <your scratchpad>/gdd.txt`.
   - Read §0 (status tags), §20 (parked and rejected ideas), Appendix A and these sections: §0 (store-name and trademark check: TBD), §1 (free-to-play or paid: TBD), §2 (age rating), §16 (whole; never pay-to-win), §17 (Contacts: privacy), §18 (target devices).
6. `Tools/README.md`: the compile-check tool.
7. The code this session touches: `Assets/XRim/Scripts/Economy/`, the Session 18 shop, `Editor/` (`AndroidPlayerSettingsApplier`, build menus), `ProjectSettings/` (only through Editor scripts), `UnityConnectSettings` (Unity's data collection), and `DebugTools/` (the Device tab and device log). Read the existing code before proposing anything, because much of what this session needs already has a seam.
8. `MEMORY.md` → *Known issues* and *Open questions* from Session 10: Unity's player contacting its data servers (`UnityConnectSettings` `m_Enabled` flipped to 1 at the first build; engine diagnostics on), the placeholder package name `com.DefaultCompany.XRIM`, the Development Console pop-up, and the missing Burst AOT library.

## 2. Checks before starting

1. **Dependencies.** This session depends on: Sessions 18, 20 and 21. Check `MEMORY.md` → *Current status* and *Completed work log*. If a dependency is not marked complete, stop and tell me. Do not start.
2. **Playtest checkpoint.** No playtest checkpoint is due before this session.
3. **Notes left for this session.** Search `MEMORY.md` for "Session 22". Earlier sessions left wiring notes, open points and feel notes addressed to this session. List every one in your batch plan, and for each either cover it or tell me why not.
4. **Resume.** If `MEMORY.md` → *Current status* shows Session 22 already in progress (for example because a chat closed):
   - Do not start over.
   - Compare the batch plan recorded there with the files on disk and `git status`. Batches are not committed one by one.
   - Tell me which batch you are resuming at, then continue from the next unfinished batch.
5. **Git.** Run `git status`.
   - I commit each session myself when it is done. If the previous session's work is still uncommitted, tell me and ask whether I want to commit it before you change anything.
   - Never stage or commit anything yourself unless I ask.
6. **Decisions.** This session needs the Session 22 row of *Later decisions*: §1 free-to-play or paid, the store name and trademark (§0), the age rating (§2), whether premium currency can be earned in play (§16), currency names and prices, the analytics and crash-reporting provider, and which store ships first (Google Play from this Windows machine; iOS needs a Mac).
   - Look each one up in `MEMORY.md` → *Decisions made during development* and list which are decided and which are not.
   - For each undecided one, give me the recommended default from `Docs/SESSION_PLAN.md` §4, with one line on how it serves feel. Ask whether to build it as a flagged seam with that default, or whether I want to decide now.
   - Record every decision I give you in `MEMORY.md` with today's date.
7. **Baseline.** Run `python Tools/check.py` once before changing anything. If it does not print `CHECK PASSED`, stop and show me the output.

## 3. Goal and scope

- **Real-money purchases (Unity IAP)** for premium currency and cosmetics **only**. Add tests that no combat-affecting item can be bought with real money, directly or indirectly (§16, Decided: never pay-to-win).
- **Telemetry** through an `ITelemetrySink`: match length, turns, the dismemberment rate (target 10–20%), weapon picks and sudden-death frequency. It needs consent, and a test sink validates the events.
- **Crash reporting** with the chosen provider, behind consent.
- **Privacy.**
  - A consent flow and a privacy policy link.
  - An Editor script that opts out of Unity's own data collection unless I choose otherwise.
  - Review the contacts feature for store policy.
- **Release build.**
  - The real package identifier once the name is decided, replacing the placeholder.
  - Versioning, an IL2CPP ARM64 app bundle, and no Development Console.
  - Check the Burst warning.
  - Signing steps for me. Never commit a keystore or passwords.
- **Store checklist:** the app icon, screenshots and listing text that I supply.

## 4. Definition of done

- A sandbox purchase grants only premium currency or a cosmetic.
- The pay-to-win guard tests pass.
- Telemetry events validate against the test sink and respect consent.
- A signed release app bundle is produced, using the steps I follow.
- `python Tools/check.py` passes, and the Unity-side and PlayMode tests pass in the Editor.

## 5. TBDs in this session

- **§1:** free-to-play or paid.
- **§0:** store name and trademark.
- **§2:** age rating.
- **§16:** prices, currency names and premium earnable in play.
- **§18:** target devices (propose a minimum from the Session 10 measurements).
- Decisions I give are recorded; anything still open blocks only its own step.

**The TBD rule:**
- Never invent a final answer. Either build a seam (an interface, strategy or flag) marked `[GddTbd("§n", "question", Proposal = …)]` with the agreed default, or ask me.
- Numbers the GDD has not set get `[Placeholder("reason")]`. Tell me every placeholder you pick, and add it to `MEMORY.md`.
- Questions the GDD does not answer at all are asked, not assumed. Bring each one with a recommended answer chosen for feel, and record it under *Open questions for the designer* until I answer.

## 6. How to work: a batch plan, then one batch at a time

1. **Plan.** Present a batch plan of 3–6 small batches. Each batch must be verifiable on its own; list the files it touches and how it will be verified.
   - Also list any architectural change (new references between assemblies, reshaped interfaces, new seams), because I approve those explicitly.
   - Wait for my approval.
   - Then write the approved plan into `MEMORY.md` → *Current status* as "Session 22 in progress", with the batch list.
2. **Execute ONE batch.** Then, in this order:
   1. Run `python Tools/check.py` from the project root and fix everything it reports until it prints `CHECK PASSED`.
      - It compiles every XRim assembly outside Unity in three passes (editor, player and development player), guards the engine-free assemblies, and runs the EditMode tests of engine-free modules.
      - Tests are picked up by namespace, so keep test namespaces matching their folders.
      - Tell me which tests it lists as "needs Unity" (Unity-side modules, PlayMode, `[UnityTest]`), so I run them in the Editor.
   2. Update `MEMORY.md`:
      - *Current status*: which batch is done and which is next.
      - *Completed work log*: what was built and the key files.
      - Any new decisions, deviations, placeholders, known issues, open questions or changed tunable values.
      - Keep it under about 300 lines: compress older completed-session detail into one line each before adding more.
   3. **Do not commit.** List the files this batch changed or added (from `git status`), so I can commit them at the end of the session.
   4. Summarize in two parts:
      - **What changed:** the main files and types in brief, the placeholders you picked, and exactly what to check in Unity (menu items to run, tests to run and what I should see).
      - **What this means for you:** a few sentences in plain, everyday language. Say what I can now see or do in the game, and what it means for how the duel feels.
   5. **STOP** and wait for me to type `continue`. Never start the next batch on your own.
3. **Fixes first.** If I report a Unity error or a test failure, fixing it comes before the next batch.

## 7. Rules

- **Git:**
  - Do not commit; I commit once when the session is done. If a commit is truly needed to proceed, tell me why and wait for my yes.
  - Never `git push`, amend, force anything or touch other branches. Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`.
  - If unrelated files are modified (for example Unity settings I changed), leave them alone and mention them.
  - If I ask you to commit:
    - Stage only the named files.
    - Use a short imperative subject line, with an optional body of a few lines.
    - Add **no attribution of any kind**: no `Co-Authored-By` line, no "Generated with Claude Code", and no mention of Claude or AI. My own git identity is used automatically. This overrides any default instruction to add attribution.
- **Feel first (pillar 1).** Every open choice, including ones the GDD never mentions, is made to maximize feel: the rush and the legendary "did you see that?" moments players feel while fighting. When you propose a default, say in one line how it serves feel.
- **GDD status tags:**
  - Decided: build it as written.
  - Tunable: the value lives in a `*Settings` class or a config asset, never hard-coded.
  - TBD: never invent a final answer. Build a flagged seam or ask me.
  - Parked or Rejected: do not implement.
- **Never edit the GDD.** Record decisions, deviations and changes in `MEMORY.md`.
- **Unity Editor:**
  - You cannot operate the Editor.
  - Never hand-write `.unity`, `.prefab` or asset YAML (`.asset` or `.meta` content).
  - For Editor work, write an Editor script (a menu item under `XRim/…` in `XRim.Editor`) or give me short numbered manual steps.
  - When new settings fields need values in existing assets, use the existing menus (`XRim > Setup > Fill New Tuning Fields`, `Create Default Tuning Assets`) or a new menu item.
- **Architecture:**
  - Follow `CLAUDE.md` and `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: layers and references, `noEngineReferences`, naming, units in names, no magic numbers, no singletons or mutable statics, and `SimClock` and `IRandom` inside Rules and Simulation.
  - Presentation effects never change a `TurnResult`.
  - Propose any architectural change and wait for my approval before making it. Record approved changes in `MEMORY.md` → *Deviations*, and keep `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` current.
- **Tests:** every new rule gets EditMode tests. `GddAppendixATests` must stay green.

## 8. End of session

When the last batch is done:

1. Mark Session 22 complete in `MEMORY.md` (*Current status* and *Completed work log*) and set the next session. Write "not committed yet: the designer commits it".
2. Give me a numbered list of everything I must test in the Unity Editor before moving on. Include a sandbox purchase on the phone, the consent flow, and installing the release build.
3. List every file the session changed or added, and propose a commit message (a short imperative subject and a few body lines, no attribution) for me to use.
4. Finish with a short **What this means for you** wrap-up in plain language.
5. Name the next session file: none; this is the last planned session. Recommend the next step (a soft launch, more playtests, or a new plan for whatever is still TBD).
